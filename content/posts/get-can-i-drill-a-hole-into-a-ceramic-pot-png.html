    <h3>Drilling a hole in glass is accomplished with an abrasive that actually wears a hole through the glass.</h3>
    <p>Does anyone have any drill bits/sizes that they recommend using for drilling drainage holes in the bottom of ceramic pots? If you need to drill a hole in ceramic tile, you could chuck a masonry bit in your cordless drill and watch as the tip of the bit skates around on the glazed surface, ruining the tile, but there&#039;s a better way. Instead, the pot itself is made of an aluminum material so if you need to broil something, say a whole chicken, then you can just pop the ceramic pot into the oven for a few minutes and it should be fine. Drilling a hole in ceramic or terra cotta pots is so easy to do!</p>
