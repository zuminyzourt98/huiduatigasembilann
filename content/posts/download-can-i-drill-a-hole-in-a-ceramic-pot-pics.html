                Drilling drainage holes in ceramic pots. After you get the hole started, just let the bit do the work. Is there a tool that i can use to enlarge the existing hole to 1 1/4 inches?
    </p>

    <h3>Can also use a direct power drill.</h3>
    <p>Sometimes i can&#039;t resist and i buy them regardless, attempting to do the french drain (where did that term come from?) where you spread rocks in the bottom to provide a reservoir for excess water. I did see an instructional post a while back about drilling holes in ceramic with a special bit, but just can&#039;t bring myself to do it to pieces that are so old and heirloomy. I need to fit the pot over a 1 &amp; 3/4 inch pipe to use in an outdoor fountain. In this diy tutorial we will demonstrate how to drill a hole in a ceramic pot.</p>
