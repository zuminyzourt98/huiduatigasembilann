    <p><strong>Download Can You Drill Drainage Holes In Ceramic Pots Background</strong>. For some reason i thought it would be hard to drill a hole in a ceramic pot or maybe not even possible. Are you tired of buying ceramic pots without drainage holes?</p>

                Drill holes in the bottom of the pot or container. Once you have a hole drilled in the bottom of the ceramic pot, you can add the plant and water it without worrying about the water building up in the pot leading to root rot. Sometimes i can&#039;t resist and i buy them regardless, attempting to do the french drain (where did that term come from?) where you spread rocks in the bottom to provide a reservoir for excess water.

    <h3>I did see an instructional post a while back about drilling holes in ceramic with a special bit, but just can&#039;t bring myself to do it to pieces that are so old and heirloomy.</h3>
    <p>But after finding so many pots that i wanted to use but couldn&#039;t, i decided that i was going to figure out how to do it myself. When drilling a hole into a ceramic pot, start with a firm amount of pressure pushing the drill down on the pot until the drill bit 4. We&#039;ve been drilling our own drainage holes in ceramic, clay and glass containers for several. Are you tired of buying ceramic pots without drainage holes?</p>
