    <p>The process required for drilling a hole in a ceramic pot is much easier than many anticipate although steady hands are a must for this type of work.

        <p>Plastic pots can be drilled or even cut into using a utility knife depending on how thick the plastic is, while ceramic pots, or other ceramic containers like teacups, can be drilled if a plant is consistently overwatered, it won&#039;t matter how well the soil drains or how many holes are in the bottom of the plant.</p>
