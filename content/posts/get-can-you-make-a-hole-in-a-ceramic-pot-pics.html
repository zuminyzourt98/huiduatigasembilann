                Here are a few tips showing you how you put a drain hole in all of those nice containers and not. Start small and get bigger with the size of the hole. It reminds me of the liner for my recently departed rice cooker, if that helps.

    <p>One will need to use a mold in order to make the correct ceramic pot shape, and allow the pot to set for at least 24 hours. I have the ceramic pot and it feels pretty thick. I had a donkey tail succulent in it, but i recently repotted that to a hanging planter. When drilling a hole into a ceramic pot, start with a firm amount of pressure pushing the drill down on the pot until the drill bit digs into the surface, then ease up on the pressure as the bit makes its way through the pot.</p>
